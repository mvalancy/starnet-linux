/* CERTAIN UNAVAILABILITY (w2 footprint, 2026-09-22). effectiveToolsets above describes GRANTS. This names the
   narrow set of granted tools the host can PROVE will fail on this run, from signals the host already holds —
   never a guess, never a probe. runOnce moves exactly these from advertised to DEFERRED: still granted, still
   dispatchable, still found by tool.search, whose result carries `why` + `enable` so the model can tell the
   Commander what is missing instead of calling a dead tool or claiming it worked. Nothing here locks a power
   behind an unlock — the fix is always the service's own setup, named in `enable`.
   A fact is certain only as `false`. true = available; undefined = the host does not know -> stays advertised.
   Signals deliberately NOT here because they are not certain: browser.* without a Chromium binary
   (browser.attach can still drive a Chrome the Commander started), channel.send with no known chat (a person
   may message the station mid-run), image_analyze (falls back to the run's own model). */
