/* sidecar/channels/adapter.js — the generic, transport-agnostic messaging-channel adapter (C1).

   The reference harness attaches an agent to ANY messaging platform through one transport-agnostic base
   class (`BasePlatformAdapter`) that owns the inbound poll/normalize/admission pipeline and a `send`, and
   translates the wire format into two normalized shapes — inbound `MessageEvent`, outbound `SendResult`.
   The agent runtime is reached through a single injected message-handler callback; the base imports no
   LLM/agent SDK. We re-derive the SMALLEST honest version of that shape for our Node sidecar:

     makeChannelAdapter({ transport, normalize, name, maxMessageLength, allowedChats,
                          onInbound, onCallback?, onStatus?, clock, pollTimeoutSec?, backoffMs?, sleep? })
       -> { name, MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH, connect(), disconnect(), send(chatId,text,opts?), chatInfo(chatId) }

   The adapter is PURE and platform-agnostic: it owns the long-poll loop, offset tracking, the DM/allowlist
   admission gate, the timestamp stamp (from the injected clock), and the `onInbound(InboundMessage)` push
   to the runtime — it knows nothing of the loop/provider/agent (the runtime-agnostic half of the reference
   harness's contract). All wire I/O lives behind the injected `transport` (a thin fetch wrapper supplied by the
   composition root); every test injects a FAKE transport, so no test ever hits the network. The
   PLATFORM-SPECIFIC parse of a raw update is the injected `normalize(rawUpdate)` (Telegram supplies it in
   C2), keeping `transport` a dumb HTTPS shim.

   Normalized shapes (plain objects, no classes — Node, not Python dataclasses):
     InboundMessage = { channel, chatId, chatType:'dm'|'group', userId, userName?, text, messageId, ts }
     SendResult     = { ok, messageId?, error?, retryable? }

   Deterministic: no Date.now / Math.random / new Date() — `ts` comes from clock.now(); backoff is a fixed
   ladder with NO jitter; `sleep` is injected so tests advance instantly. Chunking the reply to the 4096
   limit is the HUB's job (C5), not the adapter's — `send` emits exactly one message. This commit ships the
   pure module + its fake-transport test only; the real Telegram transport (C2) and the run-host wiring (C5)
   come later. */

         ignoreBots     (default ON)  — a message from another bot never runs. This one is not a preference:
                                        bot-to-bot is an unbounded spend loop with no human in it.
         requireMention (default ON)  — in a GROUP, run only when the message addresses us: an @mention of our
                                        username, a reply to one of OUR messages, or a slash command that is

                                        nobody is somebody else's conversation.
         allowedUsers   (default off) — when set, only these user ids run, ON TOP of the existing owner gate for
                                        DMs and the chat allowlist for groups. It NARROWS, it never widens.

       Deliberately LITERAL strings, not the reference harness's regexes: a regex arriving from a config field is
       a ReDoS surface pointed at the poll loop, and a member who mistypes one gets a gate that silently matches
       nothing. Matched case-insensitively at a WORD BOUNDARY (so "Ana" does not fire inside "banana"), and
       anything under three characters is refused — a two-letter agent name would trigger on half the room.
