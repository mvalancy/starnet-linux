/* sidecar/loop.js — the agentic loop. Single messages-array while-loop (Claude Code shape);
   the only mutable state is `messages`. Pure & deterministic given injected provider / emit /
   clock / signal. Every observable transition is a validated U.bus event (via the injected emit).

   runAgentLoop({ messages, provider, emit, tools, limits, signal, clock, cost, dispatch, capCtx,
                  agentId, runId, model, trigger }) -> { reason, messages, usd, turns }

   Invariants:
     - GUARDS run before any paid call (cancelled / max_iters / budget).
     - Tool calls accumulate BY INDEX (id+name on first fragment, arg-string concat on the rest);
       JSON.parse happens once after the stream, guarded.
     - STOP iff zero tool calls accumulated (defends vs providers mis-reporting finish_reason).
     - Every requested tool-call id gets exactly one tool_result before the next model call
       (assertPaired); errors/timeouts/denials become isError results, never thrown out of the loop.
   Tool execution (dispatch/capCtx) arrives at M1.2+; with no dispatcher a tool request is a
   typed error rather than a crash. */

     ALL-OR-NOTHING per batch, deliberately: a partially-parallel batch would have to define what happens when
     a safe call finishes after an unsafe one it was supposed to follow. One mixed call sends the whole turn
     down the sequential path, which is always correct and never slower than it used to be.

     Why path overlap is NOT checked here: the predicate only ever admits READ-scope calls, and concurrent
     reads of one file cannot interfere. What it must exclude — and does, at the host — is the read that

  /* VERIFY-ON-STOP (2026-07-27). The station's whole promise is that nothing is claimed unless it is proven,

       · Any PASSING verification DISARMS it — verify.run, or a shell command that reads like a real check. A check
         that ran and failed (non-zero exit, killed, "verify FAILED") leaves it armed: see vosCheckPassed.
       · It never fires without a verification tool actually wired, never on the grace turn (contracted to be

         or KILLED/TIMED OUT in the marker = not passed. The summary ("exit N (…ms)") is the fallback when a
         per-turn squeeze cut the marker; with neither, explicitNonzeroExit over the content decides.
       · verify.run — its own verdict: "✗ FAILED" / summary "verify FAILED" is not a pass, and neither is a
         non-zero exit marker (the same rule completion-evidence.js applies to the durable ledger).

  /* ONE TURN, ONE EFFECT PER DISTINCT CALL (2026-09-22 audit, reference-harness parity). Two seams let a single
     model turn repeat a side effect:
       · EXACT DUPLICATES — the same tool with the same arguments twice in one batch. Nothing in one turn can make
         the second copy mean something the first did not, but both were dispatched: two identical channel_send
         calls sent the message twice. The later copies are dropped from the dispatch list AND from the recorded
         assistant turn (the DUPLICATE CHECK STOP pattern), so every persisted call still has exactly one result.
         "Same" is name + canonical JSON of the parsed args (key order cannot hide a duplicate). Calls whose args
         failed to parse are never merged — their args are not known, so they cannot be proven equal.
       · DUPLICATE IDS — some models reuse one id for different calls in a batch. Both ran, both results carried
         the same tool_call_id, and repairToolPairs (providers/provider.js) later re-minted the second CALL and
         relabelled its real result as "[interrupted — ... Reissue it if it is still needed.]" — an invitation to
         repeat a write that already happened. The later call gets a fresh id here, before the turn is persisted,
         checkpointed or dispatched, so the transcript, the journal and the results all agree on it from birth.
     ORDER (in the loop): uniqueCallIds BEFORE repairCalls, so a tool.args.repaired event already names the id the
     transcript will carry; dropDuplicateCalls AFTER it, so repaired args compare as the values they are. Both run
     before anything is persisted. Pure and deterministic: same calls -> same ids -> same stream. Both mutate
     `calls` in place, like repairCalls. */

         model that kept going had its calls executed PAST the Commander's ceiling (cap 2 -> 3 dispatches, a file
         written after the limit, returned text ""). The tool list is deliberately NOT dropped from the wire to
         enforce this — provider-compatibility law: a request whose history carries tool_use blocks but no tool
         definitions is rejected (Anthropic), and every adapter omits `tools` when the list is empty. So the host
         enforces it here instead: whatever the model says is kept as its final answer, the calls are stripped
         from the recorded turn BEFORE it is persisted (the DUPLICATE CHECK STOP pattern — nothing unpaired ever
         reaches the transcript, the checkpoint, or a later replay), nothing is repaired, announced or executed,
         and the run ends max_iters — never 'done', whether or not any text came with the calls. The surfaces that
         render max_iters (channels/hub.js, acp/core.js, COMMS in frontend/app/chat.js) already add their own step-limit line,
