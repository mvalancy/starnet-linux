/* sidecar/permissions.js — the informed-consent broker (roadmap P1.5a).

   A PURE, injected-dependency decision function that the host dispatch pipeline consumes as
   `ctx.consent(call, tool)` (registry.js:76). It performs NO IO, never reads the wall clock, and
   never touches process.env: the frozen Full-Access bypass, the session/permanent grant stores, the
   persist() sink, the per-tool network hint, and the interactive prompt() channel are all injected by
   the sidecar edge (index.js) so the same module is deterministic and headless-testable.

   makeConsentBroker({ bypass, hardline, sessionKey, grantsSession, grantsPermanent, persist,
                       networkOf, surface, prompt }) -> consent
     consent(call, tool)              -> { allow, reason, scope } | Promise<…>   // the four-tier ladder
     consent.grant(decision,call,tool)-> { allow, reason, scope }   // record a human once/session/always/full decision
     consent.snapshot()               -> { permanent:[...], session:{...} }   // read-only, for tests/telemetry

   The ladder, in FIXED order (each tier short-circuits):
     1. HARDLINE — an injected, unconditional deny floor; checked FIRST so no flag can reach past it.
                   Its reason carries an anti-retry suffix so the model stops re-attempting it.
     2. BYPASS   — Full Access: allow anything NOT on the hardline floor. The host injects a live predicate
                   so persisted per-agent approval changes and revocations take effect on the next call.
     3. CACHE    — allow if this dangerKey was previously granted for THIS session or permanently.
     4. RESOLVE  — a read-only, non-network call auto-allows; a mutation with no grant DEFAULT-DENIES
                   under an autonomous surface ('silence is not consent'). Under an INTERACTIVE surface
                   with a wired prompt(), it asks the human and routes the answer back through grant();
                   with no prompt wired, it fails closed. Only this branch is async — tiers 1–3 and the
                   read-only/autonomous paths stay synchronous, so direct-result callers are unaffected.

   dangerKey = (tool.capability || tool.name) + ':' + tool.scope — the danger CLASS, never args/paths/keys.
   (The makeTool object carries no `network` flag — that lives in resolved.networkCaps — so the read-only
    tier asks the injected networkOf(); index.js wires it to (call)=>!!resolved.networkCaps[call.name].) */
