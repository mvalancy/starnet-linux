/* sidecar/routing/planlines.js — SELF-HEAL THE LINE MAP OF A PLAN THAT PREDATES LINE IDENTITY.

   WHY THIS EXISTS. `lineOfAgent` (which physical line a dock belongs to) is compiled by
   frontend/app/pipeline.js from the floor's GEOMETRY and rides the posted RoutingPlan. The sidecar restores
   the last accepted plan from disk at boot (index.js restoreRoutingPlan) so a headless service keeps routing
   Telegram + cron traffic with no browser open. A plan written BEFORE line identity existed carries no line
   map at all — and Pipeline.chainNext reads a missing map as "every dock is terminal". On a desktop that
   self-heals the moment the app opens and re-posts; on a headless/service sidecar taking channel and routine
   traffic it does not, so every multi-stage line silently ran stage one only, forever.

   WHAT IT DOES. Derives the same COMPONENTS the compiler derives — connected runs of belt tiles (4-neighbour,
   direction-blind), plus every machine that touches a run through its footprint + 1-tile ring — using only the
   geometry the stored plan already carries: `belts`, `sources.tiles`, `bays.tiles`, `dockBays` footprints,
   `unboundBays`, `outs`. Pure: no clock, no RNG, inputs never mutated (a healed plan is a shallow clone).

   WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not invent a plan. A stored plan records no PROP for a junction
   (the compiler keys junctions by tile), so a junction prop id can neither join nor name a component here.
   Two consequences, both chosen:
     · a component's `lineId` is the smallest MACHINE prop id it can see, which may differ from the id a fresh
       browser compile would pick if a junction prop sorted smaller. Nothing durable compares the two — the
       chain gate compares a carried id against the SAME plan's answer, the crate marker is only read for
       presence (world.js dockLineWork), and a routine's opt-in is a flag, not a stored id. The moment a
       browser posts a real plan the compiled ids take over.
     · a junction prop whose ring BRIDGES two otherwise separate belt runs is not seen, so those runs heal as
       TWO lines rather than one. That is the safe direction: under-merging can only make a dock terminal
       (a line that did not run, visible and re-triggerable), never buy a stage the work never entered. */
