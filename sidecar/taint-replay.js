/* sidecar/taint-replay.js — REPLAYED TAINT: does the context a run starts from carry untrusted content an EARLIER
   run read? (sec-taint 09-25)

   Taint (taint.js) is a property of a run's CONTEXT: once a web page, connector result or attachment has been in
   front of the model, the powers that content would need are revoked for the rest of the run. But context outlives
   a run. A recovery continuation replays its source's journaled checkpoint; an ordinary follow-up turn replays the
   stream's durable transcript (transcriptstore reconstruct / queued refresh) or the browser's own copy of it. Each
   of those used to start a fresh, UNTAINTED run in front of the very same hostile bytes.

   Two proofs, one per replay kind:
     - recovery continuation: the SOURCE run's journal records its taint (begin meta `initialTaint`, or a mid-run
       'taint' record) — run-journal.js state.taintedBy.
     - any run on a stream: the transcript rows carry the writing run's taint (transcriptstore.taintOf: identity
       match against the replayed messages, plus the replayed window of newest rows).
   The new directive (the last message) is excluded for an ordinary run: its own provenance is the caller's
   initialTaint (channel attachment / forwarded message / upstream agent output ...).

   DECAY is structural, never silent. There is no owner "clear taint" control: a run is clean again only when the
   tainted material is no longer in what it replays (a new session, or a history window that no longer reaches the
   tainted rows) — i.e. exactly when the untrusted text has actually left the context.
