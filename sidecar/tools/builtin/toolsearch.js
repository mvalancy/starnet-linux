/* sidecar/tools/builtin/toolsearch.js — tool.search: how an agent reaches a DEFERRED tool.

   THE PROBLEM (measured at the wire, not assumed): a fully placed floor advertises 72 tools = 37.7KB of JSON
   schema, and the whole list is re-sent on EVERY turn of a run. The browser family alone is 29 tools / ~10.2KB,
   and an agent needs about six of them to drive a page. That is both a cost problem and a decision problem —
   choosing among 72 tools is strictly harder than choosing among 20.

   THE SPLIT: a grant row in CAP_REGISTRY may carry `deferred: true`. Deferred tools are still GRANTED (they
   stay in resolveTools' `tools`, so the capability gate, consent broker and toolset kill-switch are untouched)
   — they are simply not advertised. This tool is how the model finds them; the loop then adds what it found to
   the advertised set for the rest of the run.

     makeToolSearchTool({ registry }) -> { toolSearchTool, register(reg) }

   ctx supplies `deferred` (this run's hidden tool names) — the search is scoped to what this agent was
   actually granted, so it can never advertise a capability the room does not confer.

   WHY THE RESULT IS DELIBERATELY TERSE: returning full JSON schemas here would hand back exactly the bytes the
   split just saved, twice (once in the tool result, again in the now-advertised declaration). The result
   carries name + purpose + required params only; the real schema arrives with the tool declaration on the very
   next turn, which is where the model actually needs it. */
