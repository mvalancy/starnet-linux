/* sidecar/transcript-run.js — ONE run's writer onto the durable conversation transcript (H2 durable transcript).

   WHY THIS EXISTS. runOnce used to write a run's dialogue to transcriptstore.js only at RUN END (plus whatever a
   mid-run compaction drain happened to fold). A hard kill between a tool's side effect and run end left the
   transcript without the turn that caused it — or without even the user's prompt — and a recovery continuation
   then marked the whole recovered prompt "already persisted", so those turns never reached the transcript at all
   (audit 2026-09-22: killed after fs_write + auto-continue → transcript `user → "Continued and finished."`, the
   executed write missing). The reference harness persists the user row before the first model call, the
   assistant tool-call turn before any tool runs, and tool results as they land. This module gives runOnce that
   discipline at the loop's EXISTING durable boundaries:

     start(messages)   — before the first model call: the directive (triggering user text), then any recovered turns
                         a continuation still owes the transcript (see reconcile below)
     checkpoint(c)     — loop.js saveCheckpoint → index.js onCheckpoint, AFTER the run journal's checkpoint: the
                         'assistant' boundary (before tools dispatch) and the 'tool_results' boundary
     drain(messages)   — the compaction tiers' STRICT pre-fold drain, and run end (both may throw)

   ORDER IS THE INVARIANT. Every message row goes through transcriptstore's appendNewStrict, which walks the working
   set in order, fsync/read-back proves each row, and stops at the first failure — leaving that message and every
   later one WITHOUT the persisted marker. The directive is always written before any message row. So a failed
   write can never leave a hole: the transcript is an in-order prefix of the run's dialogue, and the next boundary
   (or run end) resumes from the first missing row. Nothing is ever written twice: the marker rides the message
   objects (and the micro tier carries it onto elided copies), so run end appends only what is left.

   FAILURE POLICY — the same as the compaction drain's. A transcript write that fails MID-RUN does not kill the run
   and does not discard or reorder dialogue: the rows stay pending (in RAM, and in the run journal, which is written
   FIRST at every boundary and is only retired after run end proves every row durable). checkpoint() and start()
   report it through onFailure (index.js: failNote → the /api/diagnostics failopen tally + a warn line) and retry at
   the next boundary. Run end is strict: a throw there leaves the journal un-retired, i.e. discoverable.

   TEXT-ONLY TURNS WAIT for the next boundary that dispatches or records tools. At an 'assistant' boundary whose
   newest turn carries no tool calls nothing is written: that turn is either the final answer (run end writes it
   moments later) or a finishReason:'length' partial that loop.js may still merge with its continuation parts
   (collapseContinuation rewrites the FIRST part's content and deletes the rest) — writing it now would freeze a
   fragment. A kill in that window loses nothing: the journal checkpoint holds the turn and a continuation's
   reconcile writes it.

   RECOVERY CONTINUATIONS. adoptRecovery() marks the source run's initial prompt persisted, then transcriptstore's
   markRecorded() marks every recovered turn the source run's own rows already prove durable. What stays unmarked
   is genuinely missing (a kill between journal and transcript, a journaled-but-uncheckpointed tool result, the
   recovery planner's pairing results) and start() appends it, after the directive when the source never wrote one.

   Pure: no clock, no randomness, no I/O of its own — every write is the injected store's. */
