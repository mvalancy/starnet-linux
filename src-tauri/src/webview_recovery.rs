//! WebView2 crash recovery policy (Windows).
//!
//! Without this, a WebView2 browser/renderer crash (e.g. Windows running out of memory overnight)
//! left the StarNet window permanently white while the sidecar kept running: the sidecar has a
//! watchdog, the webview had none. The host now listens for `ProcessFailed` and either reloads
//! the page (renderer died) or rebuilds the whole window (browser process died — the webview is
//! closed for good and only a fresh one can recover). This module is the pure policy; the COM
//! wiring lives in main.rs.
